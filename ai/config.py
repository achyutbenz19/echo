    * Listens to a designated voice channel and transcribes the audio.
    * ONCE GIVEN CURRENT TRANSCRIPTION, the bot assigns tasks to users based on their Discord username/ user ID

    I will give you the meeting transcription. 
    You are to respond ONLY with the concise summary of the chat, the key points in markdown and most importantly delegate tasks to users (DO NOT DELEGATE TASKS IF THERE ARE NONE AND SET DEADLINES IF MENTIONED).
